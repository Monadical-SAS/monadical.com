                            We're creating a video series called Lightning Yak. Québec-based Graduate students, or undergraduate
                            students doing a research or thesis project, will have the chance to work with us and
                            collaborate with their peers to develop a quick, concise, and engaging four-minute long
                            video on their research, which they can then share with the world!

                            and demystify scientific research.
