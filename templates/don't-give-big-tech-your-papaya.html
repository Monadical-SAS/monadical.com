# Don&#39;t Give Big Tech Your Papaya

&lt;big&gt;
    
**A strategic guide on how to avoid becoming beholden to big tech while still reaping the benefits**
    
&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;

*Written by Max McCrea. Originally published 2024-12-12 on the [Monadical blog](https://monadical.com/blog.html).*

&lt;/center&gt;



&#34;No des papaya,&#34; literally &#34;don&#39;t give your papaya away,&#34; is a saying in Colombia that&#39;s typically used in the context of leaving valuables visible in a parked car, or wearing an expensive watch or jewelry while walking alone in the street at night.

Big tech is getting a lot of papaya these days.

For context, Silicon Valley companies love monopoly. The main reason for this is simple economics: a monopolist&#39;s share (read: all) of the economic surplus in an economic activity is a lot more than a competitors&#39; share.

You may want some of that surplus for yourself, but see that things are not moving in that direction. The ruling party in the US is now heavily influenced by a guy who wrote a book about how monopolies are inherently good and competition bad.

## Don&#39;t Depend on a Single Corporation&#39;s Services

On November 30th, 2022, thousands of startups cried out in terror as OpenAI revealed that they were directly competing with applications that were building against their API. 

&gt; *&#34;I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.&#34;* 
&gt; 
&gt; -Obi Wan Kenobi, AI Angel Investor

This is nothing new. Amazon competes with sellers on its platform and uses data it accumulates to out-compete them[^amazon]. 

And even if big tech isn&#39;t competing with you, depending solely on them puts you at great risk. For example, Twitter shut 3rd party applications out of its API in 2012. 

[^amazon]: Ars Technica: [&#34;Amazon reportedly used merchant data, despite telling Congress it doesn’t&#34;](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/04/amazon-reportedly-used-merchant-data-despite-telling-congress-it-doesnt/)

Given a political landscape that&#39;s sliding rapidly towards favoring large corporations, and an age where AI might bring economies of scale everywhere, it&#39;s increasingly important to think about how to protect that papaya.

### A Rule of Two

If you are building something that uses an LLM service, make sure it works with *at least two of* the major LLM providers&#39; services. 

If you are building something in the cloud, make sure that it works with *at least two of* the major cloud providers&#39; offerings.

If you are working with data, make sure you are in control of it. Store and process your data using standardized formats and solutions, not proprietary ones.

A happy side-effect of thinking this way is that forces you to build a better, more modular system, with redundancies in place for security &amp; stability!


### Own Your Distribution

Depending on a single channel like Google for search, or Amazon for discovery, or LinkedIn for leads, puts your business in a very vulnerable position.

Instead, try to own your own distribution:

* Build direct customer relationships with email lists, phone numbers, direct billing.
* Develop your own customer or business community with local events, member directories, etc.
* Own your platform when possible, and prefer public protocols. Self-hosted your community forums, provide direct downloads, organize on email lists, etc.
* Control your monetization: enable direct payments, multiple payment processors.

### Don&#39;t Give Away Your Secret Sauce

Every time you send data out to an API, you are effectively training someone else&#39;s models to compete with your business. Some examples:

* Using GPT-4 for your RAG-powered copilot → Training OpenAI on your core company information and company processes
* Running customer support through Google CCAI → Walking Google through the growing pains of your product or service&#39;s relationship with its customers
* Processing finance docs through AWS Textract → Showing Amazon who your customers are, how much they pay, etc

The key question you should ask yourself is: &#34;If this API provider launched a competing product tomorrow, what would they learn from my usage?&#34;.

Note that unstructured data, like the kind of conversation you may be having on Slack, may be the most valuable information of all as LLMs become more and more powerful[^newoil]

[^newoil]: [Conversations are the New Oil](https://monadical.com/posts/conversations-are-the-new-oil.html)

**Instead, look to keep proprietary workflows and domain-specific logic in-house.**

Note that working with smaller firms doesn&#39;t really help, unfortunately. Smaller companies get acquired and the data they have accumulated is viewed as an asset.

### Google Doesn&#39;t Trust Anyone, So Why Should You?

Google&#39;s own security philosophy is instructive here. Despite being a tech giant themselves, they treat every service - even their own - as potentially compromised:

- All internal services require authentication, even between Google&#39;s own systems
- Data is encrypted not just externally, but between internal services
- Access is granted at the smallest scope necessary
- Regular security audits of all third-party integrations

This isn&#39;t paranoia - it&#39;s how one of tech&#39;s most successful companies protects itself. If Google doesn&#39;t trust Google with its data, why should you?

### A Difficult Reality

Running everything in-house like Google is unrealistic for most companies. It&#39;s expensive, complex, and distracts from your core business. But the unfortunate reality is that the alternative - deep dependence on tech giants - is increasingly risky.

Everyone will have to make decisions about risk/reward tradeoffs. I am certainly not advocating that everyone migrate away from using Google or Microsoft products.

The middle ground? Be strategic:

- Identify your crown jewels (core IP, customer relationships, critical data, internal communications), and build strong walls around these
- Think carefully about information security and permissions within your organization
- Accept some risk in non-core areas

Just remember that as AI amplifies the advantages of scale, your papaya is only going to look sweeter.
