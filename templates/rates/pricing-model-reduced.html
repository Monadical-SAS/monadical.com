[TOC]

## Billing Rates

Monadical has a base rate for taking on a project, plus a per-developer rate for each full-time engineer assigned to the project.

*All rates quoted are in USD.*

---

### Base rate

Our &#34;base rate&#34; for taking on a project is $2,500 per week. This doesn&#39;t include any full-time developers -- they are paid for on an individual basis. This cost covers:
* all communication, meetings, calls, emails, support chat, etc.
* project hosting for the first year (for small startups only)
* project oversight

In special cases, the base rate can be lowered for large projects that don&#39;t require oversight on our side (e.g. extending an existing development team).

---

### Developer rates

We bracket our developers into four categories, and bill for each category at a different rate:

* Developer - $3,000/week
* Senior Developer - $4,000/week
* Team Lead - $5,000/week

Here are the role descriptions we use internally to describe the different skill tiers:

#### Engineer

Can design and implement solutions for medium-scale technical problems independently and efficiently. Can critically review code. Able to ramp up quickly and contribute readable, maintainable code to new projects. Able to coordinate in a team context; knows when to push harder, and when to signal for additional support or recalibration of objectives.

#### Senior Engineer

Deep understanding of technical problems and specialized knowledge. Able to navigate the costs and benefits of architectural decisions. Can seamlessly plug into difficult, complex projects or lead projects of medium complexity. Helps other engineers become more effective. Strong communication skills. Can confidently tackle significant problems while understanding impact on the bigger picture.

#### Team Lead

Capable of tackling all of the communication, architectural, and technical problems necessary to lead a complex project. Able to break large problems down into smaller parts, delegate, and identify where support is needed among a team of engineers. Able to recognize risks, technical shortcomings or practical problems in advance and make recommendations or take action accordingly.

---

## Billing Schedule

#### Weekly, up-front billing

All of our projects are billed according to work-weeks. We don&#39;t bill hourly because we believe that a lot of valuable engineering work is done outside of the normal work schedule, whether pondering a design on the bus, discussing a problem with peers, or working a late night to make a deadline. Hourly billing doesn&#39;t realistically capture the work that engineers do, and furthermore, the overhead of hourly tracking is a time-sink and a headache. We bill by the week, and you can expect any engineer we are billing for is working full-time on the project for the full duration of the week.

Additionally, we bill for all projects in advance (via either two- or four-week retainers). In cases where our employees take days off for travel or sick leave, we pro-rate our billing by day.

#### Contract length

We typically work with clients who plan to hire us for a minimum of 1 month, though most of our engagements tend to be longer-term (3-12+ months). We find the ramp-up time and cost of context-switching between many smaller projects makes them more stressful for our team, and we prefer to invest our time into long-term projects that we believe in and are excited to see succeed.

| **Total**           |   12 weeks | $210,000  |


## Cost Optimization

Our typical project is a 2+ month engagement with 2-5 developers on the team. We eliminate the overhead that you’d have to spend on internal recruitment and training (which often works out to tens of thousands of dollars per engineer for the level of engineering talent we provide).

We’re willing to work with clients in the not-for-profit, open-source, or academic sectors to provide futher small discounts in some cases.
