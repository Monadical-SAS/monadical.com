# How to Make Remote Work: Part One

*Written by Max. Originally published 2020-03-18 on the [Monadical blog](https://monadical.com/blog.html).*

*This article is about how I&#39;ve learned to be productive working from home. I&#39;ll write a second guide about how I think about remote work as a manager and the processes Monadical have put into place to make things work for us.*

&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;br&gt;

I love remote work.

To me, it&#39;s like riding a bike without training wheels. Scary and easy to hurt yourself at first, but if you can find your balance, all that freedom becomes exhilarating.

This guide comes from over a decade of personal experience navigating the challenges of remote work, both as an individual contributor and as a manager and company founder: it&#39;s written from my personal perspective. 

What follows are nine things I wish I&#39;d learned ten years ago:

[TOC]

#### Separate a Workspace

It&#39;s easy to roll out of bed, grab my laptop, and start working. Actually, scratch that--I&#39;ll just grab my laptop in bed. 10 second work commute!

I&#39;ve actually found this to be fine... when I&#39;m motivated and feeling good. But it&#39;s a bad habit that becomes costly in times where I&#39;m feeling lethargic, overwhelmed, or frustrated.

In those times, separating out a space makes a big difference. It *feels* different when I sit at the desk where I always avoid playing games or browsing social media. Doing work becomes my auto-pilot, which decreases the barrier to getting into a flow.

I&#39;m quick to block social media in `/etc/hosts` if I find myself mindlessly typing it into my browser on days where I&#39;m struggling to focus. And almost all notifications on my phone and browser are silent or disabled at all times^[I also put all my communication browser tabs in a single window on a workspace that&#39;s hidden (or minimized) when I&#39;m working.]. I only ever want to check on notifications intentionally, never incidentally.

#### Separate a Mental Workspace

The same principle applies to habits/rituals. For example, I nearly always take a long shower and drink a pot of tea before I start working. As I take my shower, I think about what I&#39;m going to do that day, which brings me into my work headspace.

I then start each workday by checking on my communications and creating a TO-DO list for that day. I try to create a new one each day (though sometimes I don&#39;t write it down), and I like to put the easiest things at the beginning of my day. It&#39;s easier to get harder things done once I have a bit of productive momentum going.

#### Work in Short, Efficient Chunks

There&#39;s a bunch of evidence that &gt;40 hrs/week is bad for the average person[^work_hours]. Not just in terms of happiness, but also in terms of productive throughput over the long run. Not that those two things are independent of one another.

[^work_hours]: There is more detail in [this article](https://www.salon.com/test/2012/03/14/bring_back_the_40_hour_work_week/). Did you know that 6-hour days are, on average, the best for knowledge workers? And [here is some relevant data](https://ourworldindata.org/working-hours) with nice visualizations.

It&#39;s different for everyone--I do know some people who seem to sustain 60-hour weeks indefinitely. But I am not one of them; I find I am most impactful working ~35 hours in a typical week. Sometimes I have crunch weeks where I work a lot more, but only a few per year--I consider them to be high-interest loans from future productivity.

When I&#39;m doing concentrated, challenging work, it&#39;s usually about 6-7 hours working over the course of a day. Lower-lift days can be 8-10hrs if I&#39;m doing a mix of easy or routine engineering tasks, operational stuff, and low-intensity communication. But those days are the minority. If I find myself having a lot of those days, it usually means I&#39;m wasting too much time doing things that I should delegate or automate.

My workday is usually about 3-4 chunks of work. The first one is short and the same thing every day, which sets up a habitual pattern that helps get me into the right headspace. A solid, productive day might look like this:

`8am` - wake up, shower, drink some tea, read some articles

`9:20am` - 40 mins light work: check email, read company chat, answer questions, plan today&#39;s TODO list

`10am` - 30 min break to brew some more tea, eat a piece of fruit

`10:30am` - 2hrs of focused work

`12:30pm` - 2hr break for lunch, gym

`2:30pm` - 1hr calls

`3:30pm` - 10 min break, get a glass of water

`3:40pm` - 2hrs focused work on my hardest task for the day

`5:40pm` - 20 mins EOD communication/reminders/etc

`6pm` - 30 mins mental review of the day: how am I feeling, is there anything I could have done better, fitting things into the bigger picture, etc

All distractions are turned off during my 2-3 hour focused chunks. I don&#39;t check zulip, email, or my phone. The only way I can be distracted is if my phone rings[^distractions].

[^distractions]: One study found that [people who checked email in batches were more productive](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858262), which certainly matches with my experience.

Days where I&#39;m working on complicated engineering tasks are a bit different, with soft tasks in the morning and then one 4-5 hour uninterrupted chunk in the afternoon/evening (with 2-5 min breaks every hour or so).

Afterwards, if I&#39;m feeling good, I&#39;ll periodically check on my company chat to see if I can help anyone with anything, until a few hours before I intend to sleep. But if I&#39;m feeling anxious or tired, I just disconnect entirely and turn off phone notifications (in an emergency my team can call me).

#### Prioritize Mental Health and Emotional Stability

Getting better at modulating my own mood is one of the most valuable things I&#39;ve invested effort into in my life. I started doing this when I was a poker player, because &#34;tilt&#34; as they call it was expensive in a very direct way. That made it easier to start recognizing all the ways mood has indirect effects.

Feeling good means I work better, which makes me feel good. The converse is also true. But it&#39;s not a chicken-and-egg thing; mental health comes first.

If I&#39;m feeling remotely cranky, tired, frustrated, or lethargic at the beginning or end of my workday, I try to pin it to a cause. I put things into perspective: what do I really care about here, and which parts can I control? What are my choices, and what&#39;s likely to happen if I go through with each one?

I have to do this habitually, because it&#39;s easiest not to introspect when I&#39;m feeling terrible and just want to escape.

If it&#39;s a struggle to get started working, and I&#39;ve been feeling a lot of pressure and/or frustration, I will take a half-day. Sometimes I&#39;ll do everything that&#39;s urgent and take the whole next day off as well. Maybe I make up for it on the weekend, but I don&#39;t feel guilty if I don&#39;t. Taking some time away from work today is an investment in tomorrow. A good rest of the week is better than a mediocre today plus rest of the week.

I have a tendency to be hard on myself, and it&#39;s extra-easy to think of yourself as totally worthless when you&#39;ve been unproductive, alone, without distractions, all day. I have to actively fight this feeling.

Of course, I had to learn how to notice the signs that I need a break and when to act on them. When I started actively paying attention, noticing how unproductive my low-points were, I started prioritizing emotional stability. I can still get better at this but it has paid off a ton so far.

#### Prioritize Physical Health

Eat healthy foods[^food]. Get enough sleep[^sleep]. Get regular exercise[^exercise]. Get regular sunlight[^light]. These things always seem to matter more than I think. We&#39;re chemical machines, and we require a lot of maintenance.

[^food]: While it&#39;s [undeniable that diet affects mood and mental health](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2017/09/food-mental-health), exactly how is not well understood, and [nutrition studies are fundamentally unreliable](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/you-cant-trust-what-you-read-about-nutrition/). I believe that everyone&#39;s microbiome is different, and different diets work for different people: I just pay attention to how foods affect me, and adjust my diet accordingly. Mostly, I don&#39;t drink coffee and limit alcohol and deserts/sugary foods.

[^sleep]: According to [this research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1739867/), sleep-deprived work is comparable to working drunk. Which always made me wonder: why do doctors work such crazy shifts? I&#39;ve come to understand it like this: if every time I had to debug a problem it was a random codebase that I&#39;d never seen before, I would have to adjust a lot of things around how I work to maximize the time I&#39;d get to investigate each case.

[^exercise]: Whenever you see an ad for [snake oil](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/08/26/215761377/a-history-of-snake-oil-salesmen), a fad diet, or &#34;clever tip&#34; that claims outlandish benefits, just replace it with &#34;regular exercise&#34; and it probably becomes true. Regular exercise improves [focus, mental endurance, processing speed, and memory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897704/). It [delays age-related cognitive decline](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jar/2013/657508/). It&#39;s correlated with a [31% decline in all-cause mortality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5574458/). It helps with [anxiety and depression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743505002331). Regular exercise is the miracle cure.

[^light]: This becomes more of a concern the farther you are from the equator. See [this review](https://www.julkari.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/78481/2006a08.pdf?sequence=1) from Finland&#39;s dept of health for more info on the effects of light on mood. tl;dr: if you&#39;re affected by seasonal affective disorder, [get a sun lamp](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/in-depth/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/art-20048298) and in any case, get outside every day.

The relationships between physical health and mental health aren&#39;t well-understood, but they absolutely have a bi-directional causal relationship. Investing in one is an investment in the other.

It&#39;s especially tempting to eschew fundamentals, like sleep or good food or going to the gym, when work becomes demanding or stressful. Those are the worst times to do so. So I have to fight the temptation.

A lot of these things take advance planning:
* I sometimes prepare meals in advance for a week I know is going to be demanding. 
* I go dark and turn off all notifications hours before I intend to fall asleep. 
* I got a membership at a gym that&#39;s a block away and cordon off time in my calendar for working out that I don&#39;t replace with meetings. 
* In winter months I use a sun lamp in the morning, and I go out for 20-40 min walks during the day whenever I can.

Over the course of months, the investment in physical health is very much worth it. Over the course of years it can be the difference between satisfaction and existential despair.

#### Communicate Proactively, Frequently, and Effectively

In an office, many interactions happen in conversations that are face-to-face. In a remote setting, the best replacement is video chat, which can hardly be considered a replacement at all. There&#39;s also a very jarring lack of incidental communication. I don&#39;t overhear my coworkers gossipping, nor can I wander over to the break room and chat with whoever is there. These challenges mean I have to go out of my way to talk to people, and I need to be much more intentional about how I go about it.

I try to avoid going a full day without getting at least some high-quality personal interaction with someone on my team, and I also try not to ping the same people over and over. Sometimes I just want to reach out to someone because I haven&#39;t spoken to them in a week. But often I am looking for some specific information. I try to be smart about how I do it.

I spend a lot of time honing my communication skills. I **always consider the objective** of my communication, explicitly. It&#39;s hard to get better at something if you don&#39;t define what getting better means for yourself. After a conversation I consider whether I accomplished what I&#39;d hoped. This is a lot easier to do on a remote team than in person, because you have pauses to think after you type out messages in chat!

We go into a lot more detail in our [principles document](https://docs.monadical.com/s/principles-handbook), but I&#39;ll go over a few of the most important communication concepts we&#39;ve developed for remote work.

First, I **assume competence** and **assume good intentions**. My teammates are on my team. It&#39;s very easy, when there&#39;s a stressful problem, to forget this. Someone I haven&#39;t had any recent quality interactions with can become a caricature, a manifestation of all that is wrong in this moment, and in my organization. Really they&#39;re probably just trying to do the thing that makes sense to them, so I try find out what that is and why. If they&#39;re struggling with something, getting frustrated with them will likely make things worse.

To do that, I **reach out early and often**, and **lead with questions**. I try to explicitly identify the facts from my judgments, and then assume that whatever looks bad or wrong is probably something I don&#39;t understand. Then I ask questions to figure out what it is I&#39;m not understanding. &#34;What is your thought process behind ...&#34; is better than &#34;why did you...&#34; which is much better than &#34;don&#39;t you realize...&#34;. This takes humility, and isn&#39;t always as easy as it sounds. When I mess it up, I apologize. If someone is frustrated I acknowledge how they feel (even if I think I&#39;m right).

#### Develop an Asynchronous Flow

I need something right now, and the person I need it from isn&#39;t responding. I can try calling them on the phone, but that can be pretty intrusive--they&#39;re probably not answering because they&#39;re busy. What do I do?

I probably just have to wait, and consider how I got myself in that situation.

I have to actively avoid organizing my schedule such that I become blocked by teammates or it happens a lot. I have to think, in advance, about how to break up my work into 1-3 hour pieces which I can do without input from other people. I also consider my teammates&#39; tendencies and schedules when setting my own schedule.

I try to respect that other people are working in their own async flows, and if I ping someone and don&#39;t get a response, I assume it&#39;s because they&#39;re busy and give them gentle nudges once every few hours or once a day, depending on the urgency of the issue.

#### Find a Good Toolset

I use SimpleCalendar for Android on my phone, which is hooked up to my company calendar via CalDAV.

We use Zulip (company chat) in an organized way: things I want to bring up are categorized in the right place. I always @-ping anyone I expect to reply to anything I say. I avoid using private messages except to talk about things that are personal or sensitive.

We use whereby.com for video chat. It&#39;s free for individuals (though my company pays for it), and &#34;just works&#34; more often than any of the other ~5 services we&#39;ve tried. I have three headsets with mics: one that is always in my backpack, one that sits at my home office, and a spare in case one of them breaks.

I use a text editor for TODOs. And I try to type up a new one every day. That forces me to decide whether something I&#39;ve been procrastinating about is really worth being on the list, and if it is, to consider why I&#39;ve been procrastinating.

Finally, I use a [good, reliable headset](https://en-ca.sennheiser.com/call-center-office-headset-usb-sc-60-usb-ml), an [ergonomic wired mouse](https://www.anker.com/products/variant/anker-ergonomic-optical-usb-wired-vertical-mouse/A7851011), a [rigid mousepad](https://www.allsop.com/product/redmond-mousepad-hex-30862/) (so I can reliably work at any table when I travel), and a [chair with good lumbar support](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/markus-office-chair-vissle-dark-gray-90289172/).

#### Deliberate and Iterate

I try to build good habits. It&#39;s so much easier to maintain a habit than to motivate myself to do something new. I improve my habits a little bit at a time: when I started with remote work I forced myself to just do one productive thing per day, even if it took 10 minutes. 10 minutes of work on a bad day is a lot better than zero because zero erases habits. I built up from there.

If I&#39;ve been keeping up a good rhythm, I&#39;ll try adding a bit more to it, but I have to be careful because I&#39;m naturally obsessive and prone to getting carried away and burning myself out.

If I find myself failing at something regularly, I change my approach. For example, it took a lot of failed TODO apps before I arrived on simply writing a new list of things down each day.

Ultimately, I believe the real power of remote work is that you can fine-tune your work experience to be exactly what works best for you. Everyone is different! 

To that end, I think the most important thing is to regularly reflect on your experience and figure out what works best for you[^practice].

[^practice]: Make sure to pay attention to *how* you get better. I recommend reading the [wikipedia entry on practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)). For something much more detailed, check out [the article that wikipedia quotes](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1553-2712.2008.00227.x) at the beginning of the &#34;deliberate practice&#34; section.
