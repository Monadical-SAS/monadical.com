`rsync -r output/ monadical.com:/opt/monadical.com/output`

## Stack

## UI Test

Right now I must test every change in the next resolutions:

* IPad Landscape and Portrait
* IPhone Portrait
* Medium devices in Landscape and Portrait
* Other small devices in Portrait

For desktop we must test in every resolution from 1920px to 500px. Or at least 800px to 500px.
