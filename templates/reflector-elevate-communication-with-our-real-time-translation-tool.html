## Introduction and Background
Reflector originated from a need to post-analyze presentations or idea pitches - to “reflect” on them - and determine a few essential but crucial insights. For example, could Reflector analyze whether all the planned items on the agenda were discussed and list the missed items? Could it identify which topics garnered the most or least discussion?

In its initial stages, we called Reflector `agenda-talk-diff`; utilizing a simple NLP program, it employed keyword detection and worked out of a singular Python script. Despite its simplicity, `agenda-talk-diff` represented a small but significant step towards leveraging NLP to extract meaningful insights from spoken or written content. Quickly, the ambition extended beyond these basic capabilities to create a more comprehensive tool for insight generation.

Reflector has advanced significantly from its humble beginnings, evolving over a few months into an increasingly robust speech-to-text (STT) translation tool.


## Current Capabilities 
Reflector currently boasts capabilities that enhance accessibility, comprehension, and user engagement. At its core, Reflector excels in capturing audio inputs directly from microphones or browser tabs, delivering real-time transcription services (predominantly in English, for now). Beyond transcription, it showcases a remarkable ability to simultaneously translate these transcriptions into over 100 languages, allowing users to view the original English text alongside their language of choice in real-time. Live demos have highlighted this bilingual presentation capability, marking a significant success in Reflector&#39;s deployment.

Further refining the user experience, Reflector offers customizable settings to filter out potentially profane language so that the content aligns with the user&#39;s preferences and standards. To make quick sense of extended input sources and to aid in the distillation of efficient insights, Reflector intelligently breaks down audio content into live topics by providing each with a concise summary, an appropriate title, and the complete transcription. This feature empowers users to browse the topics easily to grasp the flow of the event and to examine detailed transcriptions as needed.

One of Reflector&#39;s standout features is its ability to refine complex discussions into high-level summaries, capturing key ideas and takeaways in a structured, bulleted list. Coupled as it is with the generation of content-based titles, this functionality streamlines content searchability and organization significantly. Speaker diarization further enhances content clarity by identifying individual speakers throughout the recording, although this process currently unfolds in post-processing to ensure precision and accuracy in speaker differentiation.

Recognizing the importance of flexibility and interaction, Reflector allows users to edit transcriptions, re-assign speakers, and modify summaries or titles. Post-recording, it leverages LLMs to field questions, drawing on content from current and past meetings based on user permissions. Sharing insights is streamlined via QR codes or automated mechanisms, such as posting to platforms like Slack and facilitating broader dissemination.

Lastly, Reflector&#39;s versatility extends to pre-recorded audio, which analyzes and summarizes the content as if it were captured live. This breadth of capabilities highlights Reflector&#39;s commitment to transforming audio analysis, as it sets new methods for how we interact with and derive value from digital content.
